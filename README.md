Instructions: This is a two player dice game. The goal of the game is to roll a di that is closest to the target number.
The game starts off with a player choosing the target number. The first player chooses the number of sides they want and rolls a di based on that number of sides.
The second player follows a similar process, choosing the number of sides they want and rolling a di based on that number of sides.
Whoever rolls a number closer to the target number wins.
